Code written for the Texas Instrument MSP-430 for the course ECE-306.
Course -			ECE 306 - Introduction to Embedded Systems
Author - 		John Wesley Bumgardner
Description -  	This file contains a sample of some of the code, along with some required materials for the class, 
                I wrote for my embedded systems course. Because of the nature of the course, I cannot post all of 
                my code to GitHub. If you're interested in reviewing more of my code, I'll happily share it with you.

      					The class entailed an embedded systems project which lead to a WiFi enabled car that could
      					communicate with a TCP/IP client using serial communications. The car could receive WiFi 
       					commands which the microprocessor (Texas Instrument MSP-430) could carry out. Several schematics
      					regarding the control module are provided in the repository. These are not mine, but are simply
        				attached for anyone wishing to carry out the project on their own.
