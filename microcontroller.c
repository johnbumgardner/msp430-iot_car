 * Course -			ECE 306 - Introduction to Embedded Systems
 * Author - 		John Wesley Bumgardner
 * Description -  	This file contains a sample of some of the code I wrote for my embedded systems course.
 * 					Because of the nature of the course, I cannot post all of my code to GitHub. If you're
 *					interested in reviewing more of my code, I'll happily share it with you. Please email me
 *					at jwbumga2@ncsu.edu or john.bumgardner@icloud.com	
 *					The class entailed an embedded systems project which lead to a WiFi enabled car that could
 *					communicate with a TCP/IP client using serial communications. The car could receive WiFi 
 *					commands which the microprocessor (Texas Instrument MSP-430) could carry out. Several schematics
 *					regarding the control module are provided in the repository. These are not mine, but are simply
 *					attached for anyone wishing to carry out the project on their own.
 * Date - 			Fall 2018
